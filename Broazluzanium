SP1. Hey. So… this is the start of Broazluzanium. There’s nothing here yet, I know — but I’ve got some stuff in the works. Think chill videos, random thoughts, maybe some weird ideas — whatever feels right.
SP2. Honestly, I just wanted to finally start something. If you’re into low-key, honest content, maybe stick around. New stuff coming soon.
SP3. My favourite youtubers are Nutshell animations, Brody animates, Jaiden animates and haminations. They're all incredibly talented animators and their content is so creative and ENTERTAINING!
SP4. Yeah, there’s not much here yet, but that’s about to change. I’m working on some chill videos, random thoughts, and whatever else comes to mind.
SP5. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
SP6. Time to look at our thumbnail.
